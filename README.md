# Agile Board - Kanban Task Management App

## Project Overview

The Agile Board project is the final project for the JSL course, where we take on the role of a junior developer tasked with bringing a Kanban Task Management App to life. The project involves addressing provided user stories to identify and resolve bugs, as well as developing new functions to enhance the application's capabilities.

**Key Assignments:**

+ Importing utility functions
+ Initializing data
+ Debugging tasks, such as setting up data in local storage, dynamically displaying boards and tasks, and improving user interactions
+ Crafting code to meet specific functionalities outlined in the user stories

## Getting Started

+ Starter Code: The starter code provided for the user interface (UI) of the application, including the basic layout and some JavaScript (JS) functionality.
+ Mission: The main task is to implement the features described in the provided user stories, focusing on adding, editing, and deleting tasks, customizing themes, and managing the task lifecycle.
+ Debugging Note: It's crucial to focus on identifying and correcting errors within the existing functions, without undertaking complete code refactoring. The goal is to improve and repair the codebase by making precise adjustments to preserve the original structure, function logic, and intended functionality.

## User Stories

The following user stories describe the features that need to be implemented in the Agile Board project.
- **Clicking an Individual Task for Details**: As a user, I want to click on an individual task so that I can view its details and make edits if necessary.
- **Opening the Task Edit Modal**: As a user, I want to open a modal window when adding or editing tasks to easily input task information.
- **Updating the Task Title**: As a user, I want to update the task title within the modal to change how it’s displayed on the board.
- **Updating the Task Description**: As a user, I want to update the task description within the modal so I can better describe what needs to be done.
- **Updating the Task Status**: As a user, I want to update the current status of a task (todo, doing, done) to track its progress.
- **Saving Task Changes**: As a user, I want to save the changes I make to a task so that the updated details are stored and displayed.
- **Updating the UI with Task Changes**: As a user, I expect the changes I make to a task to be reflected immediately on the UI without needing to refresh.
- **Deleting a Task from the Edit Modal**: As a user, I want the ability to delete a task directly from the edit modal if it’s no longer needed.
- **Canceling Edits Without Saving**: As a user, I want to be able to cancel my edits and close the modal without saving to avoid accidental changes.
- **Editing Task Details**: As a user, I want to edit the details of an existing task to correct or update information as needed.
- **Easy Navigation Between Task Statuses**: As a user, I want to easily move tasks between statuses (todo, doing, done) to reflect their current progress.
- **Viewing Task Details**: As a user, I want to view detailed information about a task to understand its scope and requirements fully.
 

## Learning Outcomes

The Agile Board project offers several learning outcomes. By completing this project, we can:

+ Gain hands-on experience in identifying and correcting errors within existing functions, honing essential debugging skills crucial for real-world software development scenarios.
+ Develop the ability to implement features described in user stories, such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks, customizing themes, and managing task lifecycles, thereby enhancing their practical coding skills.
+ Acquire the skill of crafting code to meet specific functionalities outlined in user stories, fostering critical thinking and problem-solving abilities in a practical, project-based setting.

## Challenges

+ Debugging has been the major problem in terms finding the errors in the code, in most times a simple syntax error can cause the most problems.
+ The most challenging part of this project was to implement the features of toggling the side bar and theme and storing them in local storage.
+ Working with local storage was a bit challenging, but I was able to figure it out.
+ Trying to code by using a starter code is trickier than I thought it would be because you really need to understand the code and how it works before you can start coding.
